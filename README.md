# Boilerplate

Personal boilerplate, used for client projects, built on what I consider best tools and practices.

Consists of :
- React-Redux
- Jspm (bundler)
- Express (server) with essential middleware.
- Handlebars (server-side templating)
- Mongodb

## Setup

    cd src
    yarn --no-bin-links
    jspm install

# Run

    cd src
    node index

# Build

    cd src
    sh ./build.sh
